  <li><strong>Trader Joe’s</strong> - <a href="http://www.traderjoes.com/">http://www.traderjoes.com/</a></li>
  <li>My first impression is that it looks clean and fun. I really liked the pictures of the food and noticed that right away.</li>
  <li>The top has links to sections and below it has new products and features. It’s really easy to follow and not feel lost in their website.</li>
  <li>It makes sense. Everything is where I thought it would be so I didn’t ever feel lost.</li>
  <li>The pictures and layout make the site better. It feels like they have their brand and it’s not super busy in their website.</li>
  <li>It loaded pretty fast, maybe only a couple seconds. I do think that is reasonable.</li>
  <li>Yes, the text was easy to read and colors matched their theme well and didn’t make it hard to see.</li>
  <li>Yes, there was a navigation bar at the top and a search box. It worked well for me.</li>
  <li>Yes, it uses red, white, and black across all pages so it did feel consistent.</li>
  <li>It works fine on smaller screens. The menu changes and the pictures resize.</li>
  <li>The store locator and “What’s New” section are really helpful. They make the site stand out for sure.</li>
